# Redux quiz project

In this project we made a quiz in Redux to learn about how to interact with our store using selectors or by dispatching actions.

This project was very difficult since it was our first introduction to Redux, I was very confused in the beginning and had a very hard time to continue the project, but with some help from my team I managed to finally create a quiz and when I did some coding on my own I started to understand better how Redux works.

Here is my deplyed quiz: bali-quiz.netlify.com

And this what I have done according to the requirements we had:

- The quiz should have at least 5 questions.
- When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
- While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'.
- When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen which tells them how many the got correct or incorrect.
- You should challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components which interact with the store - don't just go for one big component.

If I had more time I would have created a timer that shows how much times that left of thw quiz, and maybe adding on some pictures or do more styling.
